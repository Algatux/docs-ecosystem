Wireshark Support for MongoDB Protocol
======================================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

`Wireshark <http://www.wireshark.org/>`_, an advanced interactive network
traffic sniffer, has `full support <http://wiki.wireshark.org/Mongo>`_
for the MongoDB Wire protocol.

You can visually inspect MongoDB traffic, do complex filters on specific
values of MongoDB wire messages, and dig into individual documents both
sent and received.

.. note::

    The :guilabel:`Mongo` protocol definition included in Wireshark
    assumes that the traffic occurs on only one TCP port. To verify or
    update the TCP port of the MongoDB server (or client), go to
    :guilabel:`Preferences` -> :guilabel:`Protocols` ->
    :guilabel:`Mongo`. If you use the wrong port value preference, all
    filter expressions will not return anything.
